# discord-keras
Creating a Discord Bot which can allow use of Keras remotely. A python enabler will also be created.

## Set-Up:

Install tensorfow (pip), node-js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Sequential Models:

As of now, Only Sequential Models are to be used. Obviously one can enhance this greatly to the point, that the entire library is easily createable. Anyways, hope y'all enjoy this project.

## Already Implemented:

Let's begin by first listing down all available Features:

1. Activation:
* elu
* exponential
* hard_sigmoid
* linear
* relu
* selu
* sigmoid
* softmax
* softplus
* softsign
* swish
* tanh

2. Layers:
* Dense
* Dropout
* BatchNormalization
* LSTM
* Conv1D
* Conv2D
* Bidirectional
* Flatten

3. Losses:
* binary_crossentropy
* categorical_crossentropy
* categorical_hinge
* cosine_similarity
* hinge
* huber_loss
* KLD
* kullback_leibler_divergence
* logcosh
* mean_absolute_error
* mean_absolute_percentage_error
* mean_squared_error
* mean_squared_logarithmic_error
* poisson
* sparse_categorical_crossentropy
* squared_hinge

4. Metrics:
* accuracy
* AUC
* binary_accuracy
* binary_crossentropy
* categorical_accuracy
* categorical_crossentropy
* categorical_hinge
* cosine_similarity
* mean
* mean_absolute_error
* mean_absolute_percentage_error
* mean_squared_error
* mean_squared_logarithmic_error
* poisson
* root_mean_squared_error

5. Optimizer:
* Adadelta
* Adagrad
* Adam
* Adamax
* Nadam
* RMSprop
* SGD

6. Regularizers: Future Update

## Preprocessing:

All pre-processing to be done by the user, including randomly shuffling the data. As of now the split is set as 80:20 will be updated in the future.
